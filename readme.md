# react_test

wow such test

### How it Works

So here's my idea for a more complex react app to build out as an example. You can create a new empty list, like "my favorite carrots", then populate that using a dropdown or something with people who work here. You could also remove people on a list, and could make multiple lists. This will demonstrate nested data as well as live updates, and should cover the basics that we'd need to make other react apps.

### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`
- ???
- get money

### Deploying

- If you just want to compile the production build, run `roots compile -e production` and it will build to public.
- To deploy your site with a single command, run `roots deploy -to XXX` with `XXX` being whichever [ship](https://github.com/carrot/ship#usage) deployer you want to use.
